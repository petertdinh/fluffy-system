# Tastely™
Learning to cook can be a real struggle. Whether you're about to move out or get married, this is a process we will all one-day face. You mess up the recipe, you spent a lot of money on groceries, and now there are A LOT of dishes that need to be done. So you give up and you get take out from now on. Luckily for you though, the ability to cook is built into your genes. The purpose of our app is to bring out your inner-chef by gamifying the learning process. Tastely™ offers a social environment where newbie and pro chefs alike can share their creation to others. We offer a list of simple recipes that users can attempt and then share it with other users. Users have the opportunity to see how others implement the recipe and how they differ from their own. With our app, users will find it easier to build a habit of cooking their own meals.
